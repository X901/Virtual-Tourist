4nd App at Udacity iOS NanoDgreee 
This app is the last app in Udacity iOS Nanodgree .

it's using Mapview with CoreData and Flickr API to display images depends on Pin Location !


## This project focused on working with Data Persistence (CoreData)
- Working with UserDefult
- The Coredata Stack
- NSFetchedResultsController
- Mapkit


## The idea :
The idea of this project is user can add many pins on the map
then when click on any pin it will open another page , if the location has a photos on Flickr website
it will download the photos and display them on CollectionView and also save it on Coredata ,
it there is no photos it will display a message "no photo" .
user also can remove any photo by click on it and tap a delete button .
also use can download new collection .
and becuase photos saved on coreData if the app closed and re-open the photo will 
display immediately without need to download it again .
